  <h3><b>Instructions:</b></h3>
<p>
    In each trial, we will present you with a prompt. Your job is to figure out, based on this correct prompt (the first prompt, on top), if another prompt (the second prompt, on bottom) is also correct. 
</p>

<p>
  There will be three options to choose from in every trial: 'definitely correct','maybe correct', and 'definitely incorrect'.

</p>

<p>
  Choose <b>definitely correct</b> if any event or situation that can be described by the first prompt on top would also fit the prompt on the bottom.
  	Example:
  	<ul>
  		<li><i>“The legislation was widely hailed as a model for the country.”</i></li>
  		<li><i>“Many people thought the legislation was a model for the country.”</i></li>
  	</ul>
</p>

<p>
   Choose <b>maybe correct</b> if the prompt on the bottom could describe an event or situation that fit the first prompt, but could also describe situations that don’t fit the first prompt. 
  	Example:
  	<ul>
  		<li><i>“The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there.”</i></li>
  		<li><i>“Victims from 90 grand jury court cases were helped by the program.”</i></li>
  	</ul>
</p>

<p>
   Choose <b>definitely incorrect</b> if any event or situation that could possibly be described with the first prompt on top would not fit the prompt on the bottom.
  	Example:
  	<ul>
  		<li><i>“As a result, Chris Schneider, executive director of Central California Legal Services, is building a lawsuit against Alpaugh Irrigation.”</i></li>
  		<li><i>“Central California Legal Services’ executive director decided not to pursue a lawsuit against Alpaugh Irrigation.”</i></li>
  	</ul>
</p>


<p> 
You do not have to worry about whether the writing style is maintained across the two prompts.
